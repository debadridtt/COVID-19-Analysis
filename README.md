# COVID-19-Analysis
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).The disease was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province, and has since spread globally, resulting in the ongoing 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic

This project ultimate objective focuses on understanding the COVID19 patterns in the most affected countries in the world, mainly USA and Italy, Spain, Germany, France and UK from Europe.

I tried to implement the SIR Modeling by setting an initial population that could have had been exposed to Covid 19 by 25th March which was declared as the lockdown in India. 

The SIR model is a simple mathematical description of the spread of a disease in a population is the so-called SIR model, which divides the (fixed) population of N individuals into three "compartments" which may vary as a function of time, t:

`dSdt = −βSI/N
dIdt = βSI/N−γI 
dRdt = γI

`S(t) are those susceptible but not yet infected with the disease;
I(t) is the number of infectious individuals;
R(t) are those individuals who have recovered from the disease and now have immunity to it.`
